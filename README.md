# Moving Musical Machines 
This project is a dancing machine that is controlled by music. A user can play a variety of different genres, tempos, pitches of music and the machines will move accordingly. Audio is provided by hooking up an audio source via audio jack in order to input the audio signal into the system.  This project is useful for hearing impaired to audiences to have an alternative method for experiencing music.

For the dancing machine, we use Zumos that react to the music based on the frequency of the analog audio input. The movement of the Zumos changes based on genre where certain genres correspond to specific movements. In addition, the song title is displayed on an LCD display and a user can interact with the display by pressing buttons to pause/play a song.  We also use a VGA controller to show the frequency responses of the music on a screen/projector.
